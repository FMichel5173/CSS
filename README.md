# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# The reasons why I chose to use Styled-components for styling:

- We can reuse naming without the risk of conflicts between components.
- We can immediately see in the component which tag is affected by the style.
- And most importantly, I didnâ€™t know it at all and wanted to try it out, and I quite like it.
